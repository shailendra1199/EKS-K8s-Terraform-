 To install aws-iam-authenticator on macOS

You can also install the AWS-vended version of the aws-iam-authenticator by following these steps.

Download the Amazon EKS vended aws-iam-authenticator binary from Amazon S3.


curl -o aws-iam-authenticator https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.21.2/2021-07-05/bin/darwin/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator

(Optional) Verify the downloaded binary with the SHA-256 sum provided in the same bucket prefix.

 Download the SHA-256 sum for your system.

curl -o aws-iam-authenticator.sha256 https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.21.2/2021-07-05/bin/darwin/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator.sha256

Check the SHA-256 sum for your downloaded binary.

openssl sha1 -sha256 aws-iam-authenticator

Compare the generated SHA-256 sum in the command output against your downloaded aws-iam-authenticator.sha256 file. The two should match.

Apply execute permissions to the binary.

chmod +x ./aws-iam-authenticator

Copy the binary to a folder in your $PATH. We recommend creating a $HOME/bin/aws-iam-authenticator and ensuring that $HOME/bin comes first in your $PATH.

mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./aws-iam-authenticator $HOME/bin/aws-iam-authenticator && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
Add $HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable.

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile
Test that the aws-iam-authenticator binary works.
